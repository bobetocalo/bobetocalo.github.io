Although CNNs for facial landmark detection are very robust, they still lack accuracy when processing images acquired in unrestricted conditions. In this paper we investigate the use of a cascade of Neural Net regressors to increase the accuracy of the estimated facial landmarks. To this end we append two encoder-decoder CNNs with the same architecture. The first net produces a set of heatmaps with a rough estimation of landmark locations. The second, trained with synthetically generated occlusions, refines the location of ambiguous and occluded landmarks. Finally, a densely connected layer with shared weights among all heatmaps, accurately regresses the landmark coordinates. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results in 300W, COFW and WFLW that are widely considered the most challenging public data sets.","tags":[],"title":"Cascade of encoder-decoder CNNs with learned coordinates regressor for robust facial landmarks detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Valle, José M.

State-of-the-art approaches typically fail or lose accuracy in the presence of occlusions, strong deformations, large pose variations and ambiguous configurations. In this paper we present 3DDE, a robust and efficient face alignment algorithm based on a coarse-to-fine cascade of ensembles of regression trees. It is initialized by robustly fitting a 3D face model to the probability maps produced by a convolutional neural network. With this initialization we address self-occlusions and large face rotations. Further, the regressor implicitly imposes a prior face shape on the solution, addressing occlusions and ambiguous face configurations. Its coarse-to-fine structure tackles the combinatorial explosion of parts deformation. In the experiments performed, 3DDE improves the state-of-the-art in 300W, COFW, AFLW and WFLW data sets. Finally, we perform cross-dataset experiments that reveal the existence of a significant data set bias in these benchmarks.","tags":[],"title":"Face Alignment using a 3D Deeply-initialized Ensemble of Regression Trees","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pedro Diego López, Roberto Valle, Luis Baumela"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538655840,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538655840,"objectID":"417081d1c3727e6442a108cbac4d55bd","permalink":"https://bobetocalo.github.io/publication/ciarp18/","publishdate":"2018-10-04T14:24:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ciarp18/","section":"publication","summary":"Nowadays, Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) have become the reference technology for many computer vision problems, including facial landmarks detection.
